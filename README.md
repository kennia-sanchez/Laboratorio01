  <li> Using an HTML editor like Visual Studio Code, create a website according to the following:
It should include two pages, the first one named index.html. The pages must consider the semantic structure recommended in HTML5 (header, main section, nav, footer) and contain at least the following HTML elements: title, UTF-8 encoding, headers at different levels, navigation bar allowing navigation between the two pages, paragraphs, images, ordered and unordered lists, tables, videos, and links to another section within the same page. </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li> a) On the homepage (index.html), include your name, photograph, place of birth/origin, major you are studying, programming languages you know, text editors and/or development environments you are familiar with, databases you have used, and any additional information you consider relevant. </li>
  
  <li> b) On the second page, share information about favorite places you know (description, photos). </li>
  
  <li> c) Check that the HTML pages you created as part of the lab have no errors, using the w3 validation service: https://validator.w3.org/ </li>
</ul>
